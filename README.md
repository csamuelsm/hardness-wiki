## Hardness Wiki

Theoretical Computer Scientists usually need information about problems, for example to make reduction from one problem to another. But sometimes it's hard to find related or similar problems to the one being studied. This is a project with the goal of mapping the current picture of computational complexity of problems in a collaborative way.
